# Simple React App to check amout of produced equipment

Simple and handy table with minimal sortings, some visual settings for user, made whith FluenUI. It helps take data from database (warehouse working point) and via API based on expressJS, show fresh and actual production department results in real time format.

In this case i work with very old database standarts, which keep information in one dbf-format file. One more library helps extract data from database file and send it throw API with one only trigger function (request) on our frontend.

Here is expressJS backend for this web project https://github.com/Danylv/express_backend made by me too.
(DBF file not included)
