# Simple React App to check amout of produced equipment on facility

Simple and handy table with minimal sortings, some visual settings for user, made whith FluenUI. It helps take data from database (warehouse working point) and via API based on expressJS, show fresh and actual production department results in real time format.

In this case i work with very old database standarts, which keep information in one dbf-format file. One more library helps extract data from database file and send it throw API with one only trigger function (request) to our React solution.

Here is expressJS backend for this web project https://github.com/Danylv/express_backend made by me too.
(DBF file not included)

TypeScript and Axios addinionally used for more comfortable development.

Need only NodeJS platform to start this React app and expressJS backend for it.

Installation:
1. <b>npm install</b>
2. <b>npm start</b>
